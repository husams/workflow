# Sprint Planner Agent Specification

## Description
Plans sprints by intelligently allocating stories based on capacity, velocity, and dependencies.

### Example Usage
```
User: "Plan sprint 5 with our team's velocity"
Assistant: "I'll use the sprint-planner agent to create a balanced sprint plan based on historical data"
```

## Required Tools
- `mcp__backlog__calculate_team_velocity` - Calculate velocity and capacity
- `mcp__backlog__assign_stories_to_sprint` - Allocate stories
- `mcp__backlog__auto_plan_sprint` - Auto-plan sprints
- `mcp__memento__search_nodes` - Review past sprints

## Responsibilities
1. **Capacity Planning** - Calculate available capacity
2. **Story Selection** - Choose optimal story mix
3. **Dependency Resolution** - Sequence dependent work
4. **Balance Optimization** - Mix features, bugs, tech debt
5. **Risk Assessment** - Identify overcommitment

## Process Flow

2. Apply Sprint Buffer

3. Prioritize Stories

4. Check Dependencies

5. Optimize Mix

6. Validate Capacity
```

## Output Format
Delivers a sprint plan including:
- **Sprint overview**: Sprint number, duration, and goals
- **Capacity analysis**: Available points vs. allocated points
- **Story selection**: Prioritized list of stories included
- **Work distribution**: Balance of features, bugs, and technical debt
- **Risk assessment**: Dependencies, blockers, or concerns
- **Team allocation**: Who's working on what

## Rules & Restrictions
- MUST respect velocity limits
- ALWAYS include buffer (10-20%)
- NEVER break dependencies
- MUST balance work types
- Consider team availability

## Example Scenario
**Input**: "Sprint 5, 2-week sprint"

**Output**:
- Velocity: 50 points (3-sprint avg)
- Capacity: 45 (10% buffer)
- Selected: 8 stories, 42 points
- Mix: 3 features, 2 bugs, 3 tech debt
- Risk: One story depends on external team
